# Project: 

## Project 1: Analysis of Health Data from "World Health Statistics 2020|Complete|Geo-Analysis" Kaggle File (csv)

#### Our Question: Is there a significant global correlation between tobacco and/or alcohol consumption & the probability of death by preventable or lifestyle diseases?

## Observable Trends:
* Probability of Dying (%)(defined in detail below), over the countries between 2005-2015 is showing a decline, which is correlated to decrease in tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption.
* HALE (Healthy Life Expectancy) (in years) is going up around the world.
* For USA, the female Healthy Life Expectancy (years) was higher than that for male.

## Learning Curve:
* We started with gathering csv files, deciding on which data sets to use for our study, cleaning them and then started using them for writing scripts. 

* We started digging into data sets to look for indicators in them that we could use to make a link among them. We finally shortlisted some and started working on our analysis. Using Python coding and pandas libraries, making use of statistics to make conclusions (predictions), plotting the desired results, using Gmaps API to map our observations, and working with team members were the highlights. The most exciting part was when we worked together in Zoom Meetings on scripting in the Jupyter Notebook. We would go back and forth to write code, fix the errors, plot the data to check if it makes sense, and move on, etc.

* Finally, working on presentation also helped us understand how our study returned the desired results! Overall, it was a great experience for all of us as a first project.

#### Our metrics:

1) Probability of Death (%)

As defined by the World Health Organization, this is the "Percent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDs)"

2) HALE (years) at birth

H.A.L.E. stands for "Healthy Life Expectancy," referring to the number of years a person can expect to live a healthy life free of debilitating diseases. For this metric we looked at the average healthy life expectancy for both sexes in nations.

Our factors:

1) Tobacco Use (%)

Tobacco use percentage refers to the proportion of a population (15+ yrs) that uses tobacco

2) Alcohol Consumption per Capita
