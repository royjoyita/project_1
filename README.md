## Analysis and visualization of health data from "World Health Statistics 2020|Complete|Geo-Analysis" Kaggle file (csv)

#### Our Question: Is there a significant correlation between tobacco and/or alcohol consumption and the probability of death by preventable or lifestyle diseases?

## Observable Trends:
* Probability of Dying (%)(defined in detail below), over the countries between 2005-2015 is showing a decline, which is correlated to decrease in tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption.
* HALE (Healthy Life Expectancy) (in years) is going up around the world.
* For USA, the female Healthy Life Expectancy (years) was higher than that for male.

## Learning Curve:
* We started with gathering csv files, deciding on which ones to use for our study, cleaning them, and then started working on them for writing scripts. 

* We started digging into data sets to look for the indicators in them that we could use to make a link among them. We finally shortlisted some, and started working on our analysis. Using Python coding and pandas libraries, making use of statistics to make conclusions (predictions), plotting the desired results with Matplotlib and Gmaps API, and working with team members were the highlights. The most exciting part was when we worked together in Zoom Meetings to write code using the Jupyter Notebook. We would go back and forth to write code, fix the errors, plot the data to check if it makes sense, and move on, etc.

* Finally, working on presentation also helped us understand how our study returned the desired results! Overall, it was a great experience for all of us as a first project.

### Our metrics:

1. Probability of Death (%)
As defined by the World Health Organization, this is the "Percent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDs)"

2. HALE (years) at birth
H.A.L.E. (Healthy Life Expectancy) referring to the number of years a person can expect to live a healthy life free of debilitating diseases. For this metric we looked at the average healthy life expectancy for both sexes in various nations.

### Our factors:

1. Tobacco Use (%)
Tobacco use percentage refers to the proportion of a population (15+ yrs) that uses tobacco.

2* Alcohol Consumption per Capita (liters)
Alcohol consumption refers to the litres of pure alcohol per person per year.
