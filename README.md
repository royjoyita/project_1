Our Question: Is there a significant global correlation between tobacco and/or alcohol consumption & the probability of death by preventable or lifestyle diseases?

Our metrics:

1) Probability of Death (%)

As defined by the World Health Organization, this is the "Percent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDs)"

2) HALE (years) at birth

H.A.L.E. stands for "Healthy Life Expectancy," referring to the number of years a person can expect to live a healthy life free of debilitating diseases. For this metric we looked at the average healthy life expectancy for both sexes in nations.

Our factors:

1) Tobacco Use (%)

Tobacco use percentage refers to the proportion of a population (15+ yrs) that uses tobacco

2) Alcohol Consumption per Capita

Average alcohol consumption (liters of pure alcohol) consumed per person in a nation

Trends

1) Data for male and female tobacco and alcohol consumption presented significant discrepencies in correlation to probability of death due to these lifestyle diseases. This suggests to us that there are likely many other factors contributing to probability of death such as healthcare access and quality.

2) The proportion of a population dying from lifestyle diseases had a significant negative correlation to healthy life expectancy (HALE), supporting the idea that avoiding these mostly preventable conditions can substantially lengthen the time an individual is healthy and able to accomplish everyday tasks.

3) Tobacco use had a significantly more noticeable correlation (and, likely, effect) than alcohol on probability of death due to lifestyle diseases.
