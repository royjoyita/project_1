## Project 1: Analysis of Health Data from "World Health Statistics 2020|Complete|Geo-Analysis" Kaggle File (csv)

#### Our Question: Is there a significant global correlation between tobacco and/or alcohol consumption & the probability of death by preventable or lifestyle diseases?

## Observable Trends:
* Probability of Dying (%)(defined in detail below), over the countries between 2005-2015 is showing a decline, which is correlated to decrease in tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption.
* HALE (Healthy Life Expectancy) (in years) is going up around the world.
* For USA, the female Healthy Life Expectancy (years) was higher than that for male.

#### Our metrics:

1) Probability of Death (%)

As defined by the World Health Organization, this is the "Percent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDs)"

2) HALE (years) at birth

H.A.L.E. stands for "Healthy Life Expectancy," referring to the number of years a person can expect to live a healthy life free of debilitating diseases. For this metric we looked at the average healthy life expectancy for both sexes in nations.

Our factors:

1) Tobacco Use (%)

Tobacco use percentage refers to the proportion of a population (15+ yrs) that uses tobacco

2) Alcohol Consumption per Capita

Average alcohol consumption (liters of pure alcohol) consumed per person in a nation
